I am third year PhD student at the Center of Bioinfomatics (CBI) at Peking University supervised by [Ge Gao](https://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/people-gegao-2/). Please see my CV for more information.

My research interest is using deep learning to decipher single cell omics data. Recently I am focused on spatial omics data modeling, including multi-slices integration, spatial-awared embedding.
