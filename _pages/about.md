I am fourth year PhD student at the Center of Bioinfomatics (CBI) at Peking University supervised by Dr. [Ge Gao](https://www.gao-lab.org/index.php/people-gegao-2/). Please see my [CV](https://xiachenrui.github.io/assets/pdf/XiaCR-CV-2025.pdf) for more information.

My research interest is develop new computational tools to decipher omics data. Recently I focus on large scale spatial omics data modeling & integration, including multi-slices integration, spatial-awared embedding.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton.
